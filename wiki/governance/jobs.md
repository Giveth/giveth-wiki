Hi! 
My name is Dani, and I’m inviting you to apply for a very important role with Giveth, because we require major support in this area to accomplish our goals! 

The world is in the midst of a grand transition as more and more humans are recognizing that we must change how we interact with the resources of our planet - what we call “Public Goods”. We need to shift from systems that extract, pollute and waste to regenerative, healthy and resilient ones. 

This is a collective effort, not any one of us is going to have the needed impact, not even a bunch of us, it’s going to take MOST of us, working together, to change the systems. And I believe most of us ARE working to change the systems through a myriad of non-profit, for-impact organizations. But it too often comes down to having good sources of funding. 

And this is where Giveth can help. 

# Giveth's Mission

Giveth is designed to be an interface between the prosocial value-driven collective-focused magic-makers, and the revolutionary funding streams that the crypto space (especially the Ethereum community) has opened up. 
These funding mechanisms give donors the confidence needed to collaborate with non-profits in achieving shared goals, including becoming self-sustainable… and gives organizations that are caring for Public Goods the ability to cooperate with each other instead of competing for traditional funding. 

Cryptoeconomic systems are creating value based economies that can enable non-profits around the world to support themselves without personal sacrifice. 

And that is revolutionary! 

Giveth hopes to be the place where every organization that wants to support Public Goods is able to COOPERATE and COORDINATE in doing so. 
This focus on cooperation between our allies is the only attitude that is required to join this organization. Otherwise we prefer to have a diversity of opinion and temperament styles. :-D 

If you want to glimpse a piece of this vision… Our Founder Griff Green’s [talk at ETHCC in 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ23oQpooG0) is probably the best overview of it. 

This job offer is focused on the ongoing development of Giveth, the donor-first donation platform. 

We need support to accomplish our mission - we need PROJECT MANAGEMENT!
