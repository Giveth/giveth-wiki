## <a name="donations">Donations</a>

Unlike traditional charity, with Giveth every donation and pledge is transparent, so you always know exactly where your donation went and get a good sense of the impact it made in direct communication with your beneficiary.

If you truly want to help us Build the Future of Giving, donate by using the [Giveth DApp](https://beta.giveth.io/)! Just log in via MetaMask, trace your donations and join other Givers on the [DAC Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.giveth.io).

If you prefer to donate directly to our address or via MyCrypto or MetaMask, you can send Eth or tokens to the following address:
```revolution.eth``` (which resolves to: ```0x8f951903c9360345b4e1b536c7f5ae8f88a64e79```) or discover all the options in more detail on our [Donation Page](https://giveth.io/donate)


## <a name="finances_expenses">Expense Claiming</a>

Giveth related expenses can be claimed through the Expense Claim form. If you never had an expense with Giveth before, you need to contact the team first.

The individual Circles (see [Team Organization](../team-organisation/)) are responsible for expenses of their members:

- Conference tickets
- Transportation tickets to and from official Giveth Team Meetups
- Food and non-alcoholic drinks consumed while at official Giveth Team Meetups
- Suitable accommodation for the duration of official Giveth Team Meetups
- Office expenses (rent,  utility bills, equipment, groceries for Giveth Team Meetups)

By default only expenses with valid receipt are covered. Any expense will be judged by the respective circle lead, its value converted to US dollars (according to [xe.com](http://www.xe.com)) and then Ether (using [EtherPrice API](https://etherchain.org/documentation/api/)) at noon on the day the expense took place. The refund will be made at earliest convenience through Circle's Campaign on our [DApp](https://alpha.giveth.io/).

## <a name="finances_regular">Regular Rewards</a>

The members working full time for Giveth are regularly compensated. Giveth uses a dogfooding approach, so every member makes Milestones corresponding to their salary on our [DApp](https://beta.giveth.io/dacs/5b37da13a239ac21b383d4da), which are then paid by their respective circles.

* [Governance](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b37e5caa239ac21b383d4dd)
* [Social coding](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b3b3a34329bc64ae74d13cd)
* [Dapp Development](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b39d45e14cec916d00dab20)

#### Regular Rewards
1 - Regular Rewards is our term for what closest comes to a normal *salary*. Who is eligible and how high is the compensation/week is determined by respective circle leads

2 - Regular Rewards are budgeted per year

3 - Milestones for RRs should be created per week and use the last day of the week to set the exchange rate

4 - RR Milestones are written *a posteriori (after the fact, describing tasks that were fulfilled)*

## <a name="finances_reward_dao">RewardDAO</a>

Every second week, Giveth rewards people who contributed their time and effort on Giveth. The RewardDAO is a system where every two weeks all full time team members vote on how to distribute 2000 USD. Please see the [contributors guide](../contributors-guide/) for more information.

#### RewardDAO
The RewardDAO is an evolving process-in-place to reward freelance contributions to Giveth. - *missing source*

In its current implementation, the four main circles of Giveth (Communication, DApp Development, Governance and Social Coding) give points in their respective Riot.im channel via pointsbot (A chat-bot that can be used to issue and record awarded points). At the end of each month, the circle leads meet up to sign-off on last periods' points. The RewardDAO allowance of each circle (in ETH) is divided by that circles total awarded points this period and every contributor gets a filled-out Milestone on the Giveth DApp that is paid out soon after. - *missing source*
